Hello and welcome to today's science news podcast. I'm your host, and I'm here to bring you the latest in fascinating discoveries and mysteries from the world of science.

First up, a truly remarkable find in the Canadian Arctic - a 23-million-year-old rhino, aptly named "Frosty." This ancient mammal is the northernmost rhino species ever discovered, giving us a glimpse into the prehistoric world of the Arctic.

In other news, scientists have finally cracked a 50-year-old mystery by identifying a new blood group. It all started with a pregnant woman's blood sample from 1972 that was missing a surface molecule found on all other red blood cells at the time. A breakthrough that could have far-reaching implications for medicine.

And speaking of mysteries, quantum computers are facing a problem that seems to be unsolvable in an unfathomable amount of time. Despite their incredible capabilities, there are still challenges that even the most advanced technology struggles to overcome.

And finally, a lighthearted note from Mars - recent images from NASA's rover have sparked wild theories and speculation, including claims of a 1984 Pontiac Fiero with a rocket engine on the red planet. A reminder that even in the vastness of space, our curiosity and imagination know no bounds.

That's all for today's science news. Thank you for joining me on this journey through the wonders of the universe. Until next time, stay curious and keep exploring.
